**Assignment 2:**
Create a console app that interacts with an API of your choice, gets some data out of it and
does a meaningful transformation. 

You should:
+ Use boolean values and if..else statements to branch logic of your program
+ Use a data structure like a list, dictionary, set or tuple to store values
+ Use a for loop or a while loop to reduce repetition
+ Use functions with returns to make code reusable
+ Use string slicing
+ Use at least two inbuilt functions  
+ Use any free API to get some information as json.
+ Add comments to explain how your instructor can set up any necessary API keys and
briefly how you are using the API
+ Import an additional module you have not used in this assignment yet and use it. If it
needs to be installed, explain how to do that in the comments, and briefly note what it is
for. 
+ Write your final results to a file **--> see print_results.txt**
