# Hello!
## Welcome to my first repository. 
### What can you find here?
I'll be using GitHub for my **CFG assignments** and building my portfolio.
I'll be showing off my newly acquired skills, especially in *Python* and *SQL*. 

### Here is my first assignment: 
With a file(s) of your choice, demonstrate the following:

○ ~~Checking the status~~
○ ~~Creating a branch~~
○ ~~Adding files to a branch~~
○ ~~Adding commits with meaningful messages~~
○ ~~Pushing the file to the remote repo~~

○ ~~Merging and deploying to main branch~~
