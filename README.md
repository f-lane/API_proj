# Hello!
## Welcome to my first repository. 
### What can you find here?
I'll be using GitHub for my **CFG assignments** and building my portfolio.
I'll be showing off my newly acquired skills, especially in *Python* and *SQL*. 

**Assignment 1:** Please find it below.
**Assignment 2:** Please find it in the 'Assignment_2' branch.

### Here is my first assignment: 
With a file(s) of your choice, demonstrate the following:

○ ~~Checking the status~~
○ ~~Creating a branch~~
○ ~~Adding files to a branch~~
○ ~~Adding commits with meaningful messages~~
○ (~~Pushing the file to the remote repo~~)

○ ~~Opening a pull request~~
○ ~~Merging and deploying to main branch~~

○~~create .gitignore and briefly explain what it is for~~
○~~create requirements.txt and briefly explain what it is for~~

You can find both of these files in main and their explanations <sub>below</sub>:  

**_Gitignore_** exists to exclude certain files from being tracked. Eg, if I don't want them shared with colleagues. I can prevent them being tracked by adding the file name, directory name or use Gitignore patterns to exclude whole groups of files.

**_requirements.txt_** lists a project's dependencies. Eg. if a user needs to have the pandas library installed in order to use this project.
