# Hello!
## Welcome to my first repository. 
### What can you find here?
I'll be using GitHub for my **CFG assignments** and building my portfolio.
I'll be showing off my newly acquired skills, especially in *Python* and *SQL*. 

### At the moment, I am most excited about...
Getting to grips with APIs in *Python*. 

<sub> And finding a way to sneaking my cat into a project! </sub>
