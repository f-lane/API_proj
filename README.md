For this assignment, I have created a database designed around the scenario of running a cat adoption service. The tables record the details of cats, prospective adopters, successful adoptions and food stocks.

I have fulfilled the following criteria:
+ Create a database with at least 3 tables with several columns, use good naming conventions
+ Link tables using primary and foreign keys effectively
+ Populate the database with at least 8 rows of mock data per table to show use of DML commands. The data does not need to be real or accurate.
+ Keep in your code all commands you used to set up your database, tables, and all demo queries. You can comment out queries you do not want to be auto run
+ Use at least 3 different data types while creating tables
+ Use at least 2 constraints while creating tables, not including primary key or foreign key
+ Use at least 3 queries to insert data
+ Use at least 5 queries to retrieve data
+ Use at least 1 query to delete data
+ Use at least 2 aggregate functions
+ Use at least 2 joins
+ Use at least 2 additional in-built functions (to the two aggregate functions already counted in previous point)
+ Use data sorting for majority of queries with ORDER BY
+ Create and use one stored procedure or function to achieve a goal
+ Normalise the DB by splitting the data out in tables where appropriate and not containing any duplicate data.
+ Provide a creative scenario of use
