**Assignment 2:**
Create a console app that interacts with an API of your choice, gets some data out of it and
does a meaningful transformation. 

**I created a program that allows you to interrogate the UK Govt's 2021 census data; specifically, the population totals (inc. by sex) at Local Authority level.**

You should:
+ Use boolean values and if..else statements to branch logic of your program **--> throughout**
+ Use a data structure like a list, dictionary, set or tuple to store values **--> values stored in list: la_data_to_print = []**
+ Use a for loop or a while loop to reduce repetition **--> both.**
+ Use functions with returns to make code reusable **--> I defined a function which returned a random item from a list.**
+ Use string slicing **--> see final print statement.**
+ Use at least two inbuilt functions **--> eg. print(), input(), len(), str().**
+ Use any free API to get some information as json. **--> API documentation available at: https://developer.ons.gov.uk/**
+ Add comments to explain how your instructor can set up any necessary API keys and
briefly how you are using the API **--> For this program, you do not need a private API key. Therefore, you can identify the correct API url by reading the API's documentation.**
+ Import an additional module you have not used in this assignment yet and use it. If it
needs to be installed, explain how to do that in the comments, and briefly note what it is
for. **--> I imported the random library. It is native to Python and does not need to be installed.**
+ Write your final results to a file **--> see print_results.txt**
